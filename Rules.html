            <p>Referee calls the ball “IN”, if any part of it hits the lines. (Imagine the ball is painted. If the ball left a mark that touches the lines, the ball is judged IN). Ball is ruled OUT, if the ball lands outside the boundary lines (without touching the opponent). The ball hits the antenna. Any of the net or cables outside the antennas. A referee stand or poles or the ceiling (EXCEPTION: in high school, club or college volleyball in United States it is allowed to play after ball hits the ceiling)</p>
