        <h2>Let's Play!</h2>
        <p>Volleyball is a team sport that imbibes positive vibes in team relationship and improvises the communication skills. The upper body strength increases and gives a whole lot of fun to the players.</p>

            <font>Step 1: Choose players(6 people on each team)</font>
            <p>There are 1 to 3 rows of players in each team. The first row is closest to the net and the back row is close to the rear boundary of the court. The person in the back right corner of the court serves the ball. We can rotate the players each time so that every time there is a new player serving the ball.</p>

            <font>Step 2: Serving</font>
            <p>We should always serve the ball from behind the line which is at the back of the court otherwise if we serve it from front of the line we will not score any point. This fault is called foot fault. If the ball after the serve touches the net it will be another error. The serve is said to be good if the ball lands on the ground in the opponent team’s court. This scores a point for the serving team. </p>

        <!--box-3------->
        <div class="box">
            <img src="images/return.jpg">
            <font>Step 3: Returning</font>
            <p>The ball should not come to rest and for that we can hit the ball with any part of our body. The ball cannot go out of the line, but the players can go over the line. We may run to retrieve the ball successfully so that is does not touch the ground, when a player hits it from out of the boundaries. This small points matters in how to play volleyball smartly and wisely.</p>

            <font>Step 4: Basic Rules</font>
            <p>Until a fault occurs we need to hit the ball back and forth to continue the rally.</p>
        </div>
        <!--box-5------->
        <div class="box">
            <img src="images/again.jpg">
            <font>Step 5: Serve Again</font>
            <p>The team that has scored the point gets an opportunity to serve the ball. If are thinking of rotating, you should rotate now. It’s common for the rows to back up a bit if your team has the ball. This is the best time to get ready for an attack. Move forward if you don’t have the ball. </p>

        <div class="box">
            <img src="images/continue.webp">
            <font>Step 6: Keep Playing</font>
            <p>You should continue playing until the threshold is reached. How many points we will allow for each game can be decided by you. When a team earns 15 points you can start a new game.</p>
